This is a React challenge from the Udemy course of John Smilga.  In this project, I use indexing to cycle through data and render the content based on that data.

<h2>What are you most proud of, and what would you do differently next time?</h2>

I'm happy that I'm able to build this from scratch.  I'm not sure that I would do anything different here.  I'm just glad that I've understood all of the concepts of this challenge and I'm able to build it again with no issue if
I needed to.

<h2>What challenges did you encounter, and how did you overcome them?</h2>

I had to understand the indexing in order to loop the data of each person (like when you get to the last/first person, and the data loops again).  It took me some time to get that understood, but I just used the console to log the 
length of the data so that I knew where the data ended.
